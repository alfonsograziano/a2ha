  "text": "I've reached out to Frank, the Product Manager, for more details on the todo list feature. Once I receive his response, I'll proceed with drafting the design specification. \n\nIn the meantime, here's a preliminary outline of what the spec might include:\n\n### Design Specification for Todo List Feature\n\n#### 1. **Overview**\n   - Purpose: To create a user-friendly todo list feature that allows users to manage tasks efficiently.\n\n#### 2. **User Stories**\n   - As a user, I want to add new tasks to my todo list.\n   - As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete.\n   - As a user, I want to delete tasks from my todo list.\n   - As a user, I want to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal).\n   - As a user, I want to set due dates for tasks.\n\n#### 3. **Functional Requirements**\n   - **Add Task**: Users can input a task description and optional due date.\n   - **View Tasks**: Users can see a list of all tasks, with options to filter by category or due date.\n   - **Edit Task**: Users can modify existing tasks.\n   - **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list.\n   - **Mark as Complete**: Users can check off tasks as completed.\n\n#### 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**\n   - **Performance**: The system should handle up to 1000 tasks without noticeable lag.\n   - **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and accessible.\n   - **Security**: User data must be stored securely.\n\n#### 5. **User Interface Design**\n   - Wireframes for the todo list interface.\n   - Design elements (buttons, input fields, etc.).\n\n#### 6. **Technical Specifications**\n   - Technology stack (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js for backend).\n   - Database schema for storing tasks.\n\n#### 7. **Testing Requirements**\n   - Unit tests for each functionality.\n   - User acceptance testing (UAT) criteria.\n\n#### 8. **Deployment Plan**\n   - Steps for deploying the feature to production.\n\nOnce I have more details from Frank, I can refine this spec further.",

Once I receive his response, I'll proceed with drafting the design specification. \n\nIn the meantime, here's a preliminary outline of what the spec might include:\n\n### Design Specification for Todo List Feature\n\n#### 1. **Overview**\n   - Purpose: To create a user-friendly todo list feature that allows users to manage tasks efficiently.\n\n#### 2. **User Stories**\n   - As a user, I want to add new tasks to my todo list.\n   - As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete.\n   - As a user, I want to delete tasks from my todo list.\n   - As a user, I want to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal).\n   - As a user, I want to set due dates for tasks.\n\n#### 3. **Functional Requirements**\n   - **Add Task**: Users can input a task description and optional due date.\n   - **View Tasks**: Users can see a list of all tasks, with options to filter by category or due date.\n   - **Edit Task**: Users can modify existing tasks.\n   - **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list.\n   - **Mark as Complete**: Users can check off tasks as completed.\n\n#### 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**\n   - **Performance**: The system should handle up to 1000 tasks without noticeable lag.\n   - **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and accessible.\n   - **Security**: User data must be stored securely.\n\n#### 5. **User Interface Design**\n   - Wireframes for the todo list interface.\n   - Design elements (buttons, input fields, etc.).\n\n#### 6. **Technical Specifications**\n   - Technology stack (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js for backend).\n   - Database schema for storing tasks.\n\n#### 7. **Testing Requirements**\n   - Unit tests for each functionality.\n   - User acceptance testing (UAT) criteria.\n\n#### 8. **Deployment Plan**\n   - Steps for deploying the feature to production.\n\nOnce I have more details from Frank, I can refine this spec further."
