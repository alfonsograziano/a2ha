Users will be able to write or paste Markdown-formatted text, which will be rendered correctly when saved.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n1. **User Interface**\n   - A clean and intuitive interface for creating and managing todo items.\n   - An input field for users to enter their todo items, supporting both plain text and Markdown.\n   - A \"Save\" button to save the todo item.\n   - A display area where saved todo items are rendered, showing the Markdown formatting.\n\n2. **Markdown Support**\n   - When a user pastes or writes Markdown in the input field, it should be processed and rendered correctly upon saving.\n   - Supported Markdown features include:\n     - Headers (H1, H2, H3)\n     - Bold and Italic text\n     - Lists (ordered and unordered)\n     - Links\n     - Images\n     - Blockquotes\n   - Ensure that the rendering is visually distinct and maintains the structure of the original Markdown.\n\n3. **Functionality**\n   - Users can add multiple todo items.\n   - Each todo item can be edited or deleted.\n   - The application should handle edge cases, such as invalid Markdown input, gracefully by displaying an error message or rendering the text as plain text.\n\n4. **Data Storage**\n   - Todo items should be stored in a database with fields for the item content (Markdown text), status (completed or not), and timestamps (created and updated).\n   - Ensure that the data model supports easy retrieval and manipulation of todo items.\n\n5. **Testing**\n   - Unit tests to verify the correct rendering of Markdown.\n   - Integration tests to ensure that the todo list functionality works as expected.\n   - User acceptance testing to gather feedback on the usability of the feature.\n\n6. **Performance**\n   - The rendering of Markdown should be efficient and not hinder the performance of the application.\n   - Ensure that the application remains responsive, even with a large number of todo items.\n\n#### Timeline\n- **Design Phase**: 1 week\n- **Development Phase**: 2 weeks\n- **Testing Phase**: 1 week\n- **Deployment**: 1 week\n\n#### Conclusion\nThis feature will enhance the user experience by allowing for rich text formatting in todo items, making it easier for users to organize and prioritize their tasks effectively.

Never assume or guess team availability — you must call the tool to retrieve the list of available members first.\n\nWhen you decide to contact a human agent:\n- Include clear context in your message. Explain what you are trying to accomplish and why you are reaching out.\n- Combine all your requests into a single, well-structured message so the human can provide a complete answer in one reply.\n- Write as if the human may take hours or days to respond, so make your message as comprehensive and unambiguous as possible.\n\nOnce the human agent responds:\n- Use their answer to continue the conversation with the user.\n- Do not keep the human agent in the loop after the initial exchange — treat them purely as an external source of information or confirmation.\n\nYour goals are:\n- Minimize the number of human interactions needed to complete the task.\n- Ensure every contact request is clear, contextual, and complete.\n- Maintain a smooth, user-centered conversation after receiving the human's input.\n\nIMPORTANT: You cannot reach out to more than a team member at a time. If you need to reach out to multiple team members, you need to send a message to the first one, wait for the response, and then send a message to the second one, and so on, otherwise the system will break.\n"
