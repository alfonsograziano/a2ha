  "text": "I've reached out to Frank for additional details regarding the todo list feature. Once I receive his response, I'll proceed to draft the design specification. \n\nIn the meantime, here's a preliminary outline of what the spec might include:\n\n### Design Specification for Todo List Feature\n\n#### 1. **Overview**\n   - Purpose: To allow users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently.\n   - Target Users: Individuals looking to organize their daily tasks.\n\n#### 2. **User Stories**\n   - As a user, I want to create a new todo item so that I can keep track of my tasks.\n   - As a user, I want to mark a todo item as complete so that I can see what I have accomplished.\n   - As a user, I want to delete a todo item so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.\n   - As a user, I want to view all my todo items in a list format for easy management.\n\n#### 3. **Key Functionalities**\n   - **Create Todo Item**: Input fields for task name, description, due date, and priority.\n   - **Edit Todo Item**: Ability to modify existing tasks.\n   - **Delete Todo Item**: Option to remove tasks from the list.\n   - **Mark as Complete**: Checkbox or toggle to indicate task completion.\n   - **Filter and Sort**: Options to filter by priority or due date and sort tasks.\n\n#### 4. **Design Constraints**\n   - Must be responsive for mobile and desktop views.\n   - Should adhere to the existing UI/UX guidelines of the application.\n   - Consideration for accessibility features.\n\n#### 5. **Technical Requirements**\n   - Frontend: React.js (or preferred framework).\n   - Backend: Node.js with Express (or preferred technology).\n   - Database: MongoDB (or preferred database).\n\n#### 6. **Acceptance Criteria**\n   - All functionalities must be tested and verified.\n   - User feedback should be collected post-launch for future improvements.\n\nOnce I have Frank's input, I can refine this spec further.",

Once I receive his response, I'll proceed to draft the design specification. \n\nIn the meantime, here's a preliminary outline of what the spec might include:\n\n### Design Specification for Todo List Feature\n\n#### 1. **Overview**\n   - Purpose: To allow users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently.\n   - Target Users: Individuals looking to organize their daily tasks.\n\n#### 2. **User Stories**\n   - As a user, I want to create a new todo item so that I can keep track of my tasks.\n   - As a user, I want to mark a todo item as complete so that I can see what I have accomplished.\n   - As a user, I want to delete a todo item so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.\n   - As a user, I want to view all my todo items in a list format for easy management.\n\n#### 3. **Key Functionalities**\n   - **Create Todo Item**: Input fields for task name, description, due date, and priority.\n   - **Edit Todo Item**: Ability to modify existing tasks.\n   - **Delete Todo Item**: Option to remove tasks from the list.\n   - **Mark as Complete**: Checkbox or toggle to indicate task completion.\n   - **Filter and Sort**: Options to filter by priority or due date and sort tasks.\n\n#### 4. **Design Constraints**\n   - Must be responsive for mobile and desktop views.\n   - Should adhere to the existing UI/UX guidelines of the application.\n   - Consideration for accessibility features.\n\n#### 5. **Technical Requirements**\n   - Frontend: React.js (or preferred framework).\n   - Backend: Node.js with Express (or preferred technology).\n   - Database: MongoDB (or preferred database).\n\n#### 6. **Acceptance Criteria**\n   - All functionalities must be tested and verified.\n   - User feedback should be collected post-launch for future improvements.\n\nOnce I have Frank's input, I can refine this spec further."
